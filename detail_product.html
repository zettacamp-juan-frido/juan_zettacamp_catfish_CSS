      A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small,
      flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of
      oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins,
      oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

      Most English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies biscuits, except for
      the United States and Canada, where biscuit refers to a type of quick
      bread. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United
      Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date
      squares or bars.
