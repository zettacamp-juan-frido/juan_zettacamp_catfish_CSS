          <p>
            The Raiden Shogun exists in two formsâ€”Ei, her true identity, and the
            Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in her
            stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet
            follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely
            hard to modify even by Ei herself. The Shogun is cold and stern in
            personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional
            expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for
            recreation. The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant, and does
            exactly as she wishes, no more and no less; she cannot act without
            Ei's direction, and if her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun
            becomes incapable of doing anything. Due to her limited protocols
            and Ei's initial indifference for anything other than her goal of
            eternity, the puppet can easily be manipulated by outside forces.
            For example, the Kujou Clan and the Fatui tricked her into
            initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.
